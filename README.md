# SimpleShop — Minimal E‑commerce Page

This is a simple, single-page e‑commerce demo built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS. It includes five sections and a lightweight cart.

## Sections
- Hero: short pitch and CTA
- Categories: filter products by category
- Products: featured items grid
- Deals: discounted items
- Testimonials: customer quotes

## Files
- [index.html](../index.html): Page markup and sections
- [styles.css](../styles.css): Styling and responsive layout
- [script.js](../script.js): Products, filtering, and cart logic

## Run Locally (Windows)
You can simply open [index.html](../index.html) in your browser (double-click).

Optionally, start a local server for a smoother experience:

```powershell
cd D:\projects\test
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

## Notes
- All product images use placeholder sources from picsum.photos.
- Cart data is stored in localStorage and cleared by your browser tools.
